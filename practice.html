<h2>Missy and her dangerous adventures</h2>
<p>Missy is our pup (so she still thinks) that we have had for 13 years. She is a very loving and active dog that enjoys to bark for attention non stop and revel in said attention. She is the clumsiest dog I have ever met, that loves to run in the garden through all the bushes and usually come out covered in brambles. One day she went on her adventures and came back with a sore eye. Once we took her to the vets they had told us something had struck her eye or she had banged her head and that the eye had to be removed. After the surgery she was down in the dumps having to parade around with a huge cone on her head, however since having the cone taken off she is back to her usual chipper self with the burning passion to go and adventure again.</p>
